# Project1-WD-FT-10-2019 - City Run

This game is created with P5.js including the p5.dom library.
City Run is a simple jump and run browser game. Which was supposed to have twist where the player needs to answer a question when a lives-item is encountered, in order to gain more lives.
The question triggered by the lives-symbol was supposed to be entered in an input field created with DOM manipulation in p5.js. The problem of triggering only one question at a collision and closing the input field after a question is answered has not been solved yet. Thus this is a light version of the game.
